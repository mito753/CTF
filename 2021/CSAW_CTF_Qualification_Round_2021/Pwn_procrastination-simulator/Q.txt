Oh noes! I partied all weekend and now it's an hour before the CTF ends and I have school deadlines tonight too. Can you help me write 60 reports and pwn 50 challenges by Sunday afternoon? nc auto-pwn.chal.csaw.io 11001 with password cd80d3cd8a479a18bbc9652f3631c61c

Hint
Ã—
This hint updates an earlier hint pointing out that the passwords associated with the last level of this challenge would regenerate to random values if we had to reset our infrastructure. This problem has been fixed, so the passwords to each of the binaries are static. Happy auto-pwning!
